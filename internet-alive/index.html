                <p>You know what I miss? The old internet.</p>
                <p>A network of personal websites dedicated to specific niches, not seeking a profit or similar gain, but instead, places where people shared their interests purely out of their own interest.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I'm the wrong person to say this – after all, having been born in 2001, I am not old enough to have grown up experiencing the 90's internet, or even the early 2000's internet. My first internet access must have been in the late 00's, while I only got my first laptop in 2011.</p>
                <p>Yet, I find enjoyment in viewing other people's personal internet pages. There's something oddly charming about viewing the personal interests of people – of course only those that they allow the world to see.</p>
                <p>This is why I'm working on my own website. I want to contribute to a web that's based not on commercialism and hype technology, but rooted in personal interests and interesting experiences.</p>
                <p>I miss the times of non-commercialised, non-commodified websites, where each and every website was a unique experience.</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that we need to go back to primitive technology. Neither should we force ourselves to write pages in pure HTML or minimal CSS (though it is appreciated). It doesn't have to be restricted to websites either – let's all try to let our creativity flow freely, exploring niches that interest us out of passion, not for profit. Let us create more media, for the sake of expression and sharing.</p>
