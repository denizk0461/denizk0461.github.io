        <p>
            This privacy policy for the Android application WeserPlaner ('app') by Deniz Düzgören ('developer') describes whether and how the app collects, stores, uses, and shares personal user information when you use the app.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE COLLECTED?
        </h2>
        <p>
            No information is collected from the user. The app never connects to an external server owned by the developer. Data processing may only occur in the form of cookies by accessing the websites of the University of Bremen through the app, which, however, is outside of the app's control.
        </p>
        <h2>
            HOW IS INFORMATION PROCESSED?
        </h2>
        <p>
            User information will be processed locally on the device to display the app's elements in order to serve core functionality. This information never leaves the end user's device.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT LEGAL BASIS IS GIVEN TO PROCESS USER DATA?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Should we ever store user information outside of the user's device, then this will only ever occur with the user's explicit consent, as governed by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHEN AND WITH WHOM WILL USER DATA BE SHARED?
        </h2>
        <p>
            User data will never be shared with anyone.
        </p>
        <h2>
            HOW LONG WILL USER INFORMATION BE KEPT FOR?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since no user data will be stored outside of the user's device, there will never be user information to keep.
        </p>
        <h2>
            HOW IS INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM MINORS?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The app is not marketed to children under 18 years of age. Should children use this app, no data will be collected from them, as is true for any other user.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Through the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to greater access and control over your personal information.

            Should you have any questions about this app's data collection practices, or you believe that information has been collected from you unwillingly, please contact the developer at:
