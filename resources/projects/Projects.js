The substitution app allowed me to be more quickly informed about my courses, as it notified me about any cancellations and changes in my schedule. It also allowed me to view the canteen offers, even though I'd never eaten at the school's canteen.<br><br>The app was initially developed in Java and later converted into Kotlin as part of my Kotlin learning effort. The backend of the app, since the school website required a login to view the substitution plan, ran on a Raspberry Pi 3B using a Python script that scraped the website using Selenium and sent out notifications via Firebase. The Raspberry Pi crashed frequently and the script was not perfect, requiring me to frequently remote into the Pi using VNC, often while I was at school, to edit the script!<br><br>Since the app was written for native Android but a few of my classmates had iPhones, I had an iOS version in the works, which even got to a finished state at one point, but since I lacked funding to pay the $99-a-year fee Apple charges developers, it was never published.<br><br>This app was genuinely one of my most fun projects, not only serving me as a handy tool, but also being a great playground for my programming practice, since it taught me to build UIs, use databases, and more. The app had been downloaded by 250 other students at my school, which I was – and still am – very proud of.",
