Initially, I was deterred by the album's substantial use of instruments over synthesisers, as I had previously listened to a lot of electronic music. A few songs stuck with me though, so I kept listening, and over the course of these listens, I grew from somewhat liking a few passages to loving the album from its first second to its very end. <strong>fishmonger</strong> reminds me of my times working my first job to pay student life, but it also reminds me of significant low points in my life. Whether that might be in identifying with more jovial-sounding songs such as <i>Bozo bozo bozo</i>, daydreaming alongside the second half of <i>Dry land 2001</i>, or drowning in the emotional impact of <i>Del mar county fair 2008</i>.",

This 10-minute EP is truly a breath of fresh air.",
