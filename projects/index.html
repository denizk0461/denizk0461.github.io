                    <p class="gallery-item-content"><b>Dreamworld</b> is my first album. I always wanted to write a cohesive piece of media, and <b>Dreamworld</b> was my first stab at this task. Originally, I had planned to write an album in the month of July 2020, but that fell flat entirely, instead starting out with the production of <i>Monophobia</i> – a track name inspired by deadmau5' track of the same title – and working on the album until September of the year thereafter.<br><br>I had started the track <i>Dreamworld</i> back in 2019, only adapting it to the project as I thought it would fit thematically. Coincidentally, <i>Flawed Romance</i> shares the same chord progression, which genuinely only happened because I accidentally wrote the same progression twice.<br><br>The cover for <b>Dreamworld</b> is an edited picture of the Wallanlagen in Bremen, featuring a tree that fell and broke a year later. As such, this scene does not exist in quite the same way it did back then anymore.<br><br>I own a vinyl record of this album, produced as a one-off by <a href="https://beevinyl.com/">beevinyl</a>.</p>

                    <p class="gallery-item-content"><b>Qwark</b> was an app I used to track relevant information for my time at gymnasium. Initially, it was only meant to track my grades in exams and whatnot, but its capabilities grew to calculate my report card grades and my final grade once I graduated. It was also able to keep simple notes which could be checked off to mark them as done, and it also had a built-in counter I used during lessons to track how often I raised my hand and how often I verbally contributed to classes! A discipline I severely struggled in.<br><br>The app was named after Captain Qwark, the clumsy hero figure from the Ratchet & Clank series who never really gets his affairs in order. I suppose this referenced me personally more so than the app, since I was the one who needed help with tracking relevant information – a task for which the app proved very helpful!<br><br>The app reached EOL when I graduated from gymnasium, since I had no use for it anymore, and no one else ever used it either.</p>

                    <p class="gallery-item-content"><b>AvH-Vertretungsplan</b> was an app I developed back in 2019 to view the substitution plan of my school more easily, since I disliked the poor, disorganised design of the school's website. The substitution app allowed me to be more quickly informed about my courses, as it notified me about any cancellations and changes in my schedule. It also allowed me to view the canteen offers, even though I'd never eaten at the school's canteen.<br><br>The app was initially developed in Java and later converted into Kotlin as part of my Kotlin learning effort. The backend of the app, since the school website required a login to view the substitution plan, ran on a Raspberry Pi 3B using a Python script that scraped the website using Selenium and sent out notifications via Firebase. The Raspberry Pi crashed frequently and the script was not perfect, requiring me to frequently remote into the Pi using VNC, often while I was at school, to edit the script!<br><br>Since the app was written for native Android but a few of my classmates had iPhones, I had an iOS version in the works, which even got to a finished state at one point, but since I lacked funding to pay the $99-a-year fee Apple charges developers, it was never published.<br><br>This app was genuinely one of my most fun projects, not only serving me as a handy tool, but also being a great playground for my programming practice, since it taught me to build UIs, use databases, and more. The app had been downloaded by 250 other students at my school, which I was – and still am – very proud of.</p>
