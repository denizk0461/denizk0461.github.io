            <p><b>Totally Accurate Dating Simulator</b> is, as the name suggests, a series of particularly realistic dating simulator experiences. Dive into a world of romance as you meet your matches, intriguing and disappointing. Who will you meet? Will it be someone your type? That's subjective, and the computer will not even slightly attempt to match you with someone suitable. Prepare yourself for matches that are rarely described with "intriguing" and much more frequently with "funny." Oh, and lower your expectations. Significantly.</p>
