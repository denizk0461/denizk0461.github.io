                <p>This is the development log for my game <b>Project N5</b>. Updates are shown in reverse chronological order.</p>

                <h2 class="gradient-title">December 2023</h2>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Worldbuilding – Toasters</h3>
                <p>Adapted from the early animations, I present: Deniz' Quality Toasters! A fictitious toaster manufacturing company bearing my name – maybe they manufacture more than just toasters? The logo is using the font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico">Pacifico</a>.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/dqt.webp">
                <p>I don't actually know whether I'll use this in any way, I just wanted to create this logo for the sake of it.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Character II</h3>
                <p>For testing animations, I created a new rigged character. This character is segmented, using separate objects for its arms, fingers, legs, etc. The final protagonist will use completely separate objects, since the character will be a robot. This will also reduce the work I will need to do in weight painting, and make mesh bends trivial – which is to say, not necessary.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/2023-12-12_00.webp">
                <p>Rigging remains as difficult as ever. The final model – which won't be based on this model but use a similar rig, hopefully the same so that animations can be carried over 1:1 – will have separate segments for the fingers, so that bends like this will never occur.</p>
                <p>Notice that the character only has four fingers per hand. This should reduce animation work somewhat. Also, I came to realise – why even put five fingers on a robot? It's not like we as humans even utilise our five fingers very efficiently. I've found myself struggling to keep my pinky out of my way countless times.</p>

                <p><code>hello world! nice to meet you</code></p>
                <p>This uses 1-frame animations to achieve posing. My first attempt at using animations in Godot! Worked really well, actually. All I fear now is playing multiple animations at once. Is that even possible? I don't know yet.</p>

                <p>And finally, a shot of the character holding the weapon correctly. This was actually super easy to achieve. The weapon is parented to a node that's attached to the right hand bone of the model. This makes posing and animations loads easier, since the equipped item does not have to be moved manually.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Glowing Weaponry</h3>
                <p>I was struggling for SO LONG to get this weapon to glow. Using a <code>WorldEnvironment</code> node just wouldn't work, the weapon never glowed. Then, I figured out that, at some point, I disabled glow in the entire scene... and after changing that – and trying other things for 1.5 hours before that point – the weapon was glowing! Not quite the way I want it to, but that's easy to tweak. Only downside is that my character started glowing as well, for some reason, but I'll figure that out another time.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/2023-12-08.webp">

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Identity Crisis</h3>
                <p>I started creating a logo for my game! I settled on the name <b>Project N5</b> as a working title, and perhaps as a final title for the game as well. Here's all the logos I created thus far:</p>
                <p>Logo #0 is just an outline using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit">Kanit</a>. This is the font I also decided on for all of the in-game menus and text. The 5 is special though; it is based on a part salvaged from a hard drive. On a slow day, my coworker disassembled some defective mechanical hard drives, and I got to keep the parts. I thought it would look quite cool as a highlight for the game's logo, and perhaps function as a part of the in-game antagonist company that I'm planning to write the story around.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted light-background" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-outline.webp">
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/hdd.webp">
                <p>Logo #1 gained a fill, wider stroke, and a pattern fill that's straight outta Inkscape.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted light-background" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-fill-v1.webp">
                <p>#2 reserves the pattern fill for the N5 part and colours the 5 in the game's main yellow colour, #D4AB49. It's also much thicker.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-v2.webp">
                <p>Version 3 is a complete overhaul, still using Kanit for the N, keeping the custom 5, but changing the font of the word 'Project' to <a href="https://www.collletttivo.it/typefaces/apfel-grotezk">Apfel Grotezk</a>. Unfortunately, that font doesn't really work well in all-caps. The J just stood out too poorly for my liking, and friends comfirmed it.</p>
                <p>The hexagonal background behind the N5 actually was a fairly random addition, but I liked it so much that it continued to stick. I think this could also serve as part of the player's HUD. Maybe as an element that shows the level of the currently equipped weapon? I love when ideas sprout from random decisions like this!</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-v3.webp">
                <p>I also tried <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a>, but that looked too standard, and not quite as expressive as I wanted it to. Relatively speaking, considering we're talking about regular sans-serif fonts, of course.</p>
                <p>A friend also suggested I cut apart the top part of the 5, leaving a gap, and I think that looked quite cool! I continued that trend for the HDD-inspired bits on the lower part of the 5, simplifying them, detaching them from the main bottom part, and even removing one element. The element that was removed actually served as the part that sticks out in the upper part of the lower part – if that makes sense. It's now located near the cutting point between the upper and lower parts of the digit.</p>
                <p>I also tore apart the N on my own volition. Thought it looked cool.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-v4.webp">
                <p>This logo uses <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Monserrat ExtraBold</a>. I actually quite liked this font; it looked unified, bold, and actually quite fitting for my vision!</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-v5.webp">
                <p>Then I inset the C into the T, creating a neat little cutout effect.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-v6.webp">
                <p>I then decided to put a splash of colour behind the 'Project' wordmark, and highlighting the background with two hexagons.</p>
                <p>Do you think the comment is right? I'm unsure. Amongst all the people I've shown this logo to, the decision has been split 50/50. I just don't want people to consider this the 'dick logo.'</p>
                <p>I've also received comments from some people who are irked by the T in 'Project' overlapping with the background of the N5. I actually quite like that feature, but I'll take it into consideration, and maybe change it in the near future.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-12/projectn5-logo-v7.webp">
                <p>And lastly, a little draft logo I created, based on #7, in <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.net</a>, which is why it doesn't look as clean as the other ones, which are all vector-based logos created in Inkscape.</p>
                <p>I want my work to be transferrable and easily scale-able after all, you know?</p>

                <h2 class="gradient-title">November 2023</h2>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">My Best Friend JSON</h3>
                <p>It might seem simple (or look complicated), but I came up with the idea of creating a JSON-based lookup table for the weapon metadata. Using this, it's quite easy to retrieve any kind of information about any kind of weapon without needing to hardcode it into the weapon itself. Here's an early screenshot of the lookup table.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-11/2023-11-25.webp">

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Inventory System</h3>
                <p>I implemented an inventory system somewhat akin to Ratchet & Clank's. It shows the weapons the player has acquired, previewing the model in a 3D sub-viewport. Later, it will also show the weapon's name, remaining ammo, perhaps statistics such as damage, and a description. But that's a task for later.</p>
                <p>The only reason that the Purple Gun as well as the N5 Blaster show up multiple times is because I wanted to test all inventory slots, and I didn't have any weapons other than those two implemented.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Real-World Testing</h3>
                <p>On a whim, I decided to import the N5 Blaster's model into my game. Doing that was honestly quite the motivational boost at the time, as it visualised my progress. I could actually play <i>my game</i> with <i>my weapon!</i> It's not finished at all, it has no proper mechanics implemented other than the shooting copied from the Purple Gun, and the glass is also not actually transparent.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">A Star is Born</h3>
                <p>I begun modelling my protagonist! I didn't progress far, as I currently lack a vision for where I really want my character to go in detail. I have slight ideas – inspirations are, for example, <a href="https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Merc_and_Green">Merc & Green from Ratchet: Gladiator</a>, and <a href="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-11/denholm.webp">Denholm Reynholm</a>. I quite liked the idea of having glowing tubes on the character's back; I got the inspiration from a Blender tutorial that was randomly recommended to me one morning.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Gearing Up</h3>
                <p>Lots of progress on the 3D models! I modelled the first weapon for the game, the N5 Blaster, from start to finish!</p>
                <p>The earliest version was based on an 8-sided cylinder. After some feedback from friends, I remade the weapon, using a 16-sided cylinder, and also adding more details to the weapon overall. More attention went into the grip, which now resembled a weapon grip more so than a stick.</p>
                <div class="horizontally-aligned width-restricted">
                    <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-11/2023-11-05_00.webp">

                <p>The final version of the weapon layers a black wireframe on top of the icosphere, so that in the game it's a bit more clearly visible that it rotates, and it uses smooth shading. I was against using smooth shading initially, as I wanted to go for a low-poly artstyle, but I think that approach just looked a bit cheap, considering my 3D models aren't exactly high-quality by themselves. Smooth shading gives the impression of smooth, high-poly models at a significant reduction in vertices.</p>
                <img class="image-block centred width-restricted" src="/resources/projects/projectn5/devlog/2023-11/2023-12-11.webp">
                <p>Here's the icon for the N5 Blaster that's to be used in the quick select menu, the item menu, and the HUD. The icon will be tinted in different colours when the weapon has been levelled up.</p>
                <p>In my first attempt at creating this icon, I took a picture of the wireframed icosphere that's in the weapon, and I tried to vectorise it using Inkscape. That didn't work the way I wanted, so I hand-traced all the lines from the icosphere. I was confused as to why it's not symmetrical, but I later realised that that's just how the icosphere looks.</p>

                <p>I also continued work on the battle axe, giving it more character. It's still not close to being finished, but it's now a bit less of a rough draft.</p>

                <p>I will admit though that I'm unsure whether I'll actually stick with the battle axe as the protagonist's main melee weapon.</p>
                <p>Another idea, though more as an unlockable extra, is Derek the crowbar.</p>

                <p>I also worked on the upgrade for the N5 Blaster, the N5 Cannon. Progress on that one has been a bit slow, since I have yet to figure out what kind of weapon I want the upgraded version to be.</p>

                <p>In order to test animation and rigging of arbitrary 3D models, I created these bread-centred animations.

                <p>In order to get started with the 3D models I'll need to create for the game, I attempted to begin the process of modelling the weapon of the protagonist! It's supposed to become a battle axe, though I have not yet finalised whether I'll keep with the idea.</p>

                <p>I've done some work on the quick select menu to get it functional. The goal is to emulate its behaviour in the Ratchet & Clank games (duh). Current functionality is as follows:</p>
                <p>The Quick Select menu opens when the E key (keyboard) or the North face button (controller) is pressed, and closes once the button is released. Using the Keyboard/Mouse control layout, the player is able to pick a weapon by hovering over it. The focussed weapon is equipped once the Quick Select menu is closed. Controller users point the left stick in the desired direction to focus on an item.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">What Are the Controls??</h3>
                <p>We have a controls screen! This task would have been easier if the game was specific to a console, thus necessitating only one controller layout. Instead, I used Godot's <code>Input.get_joy_name()</code> function to retrieve the first connected controller's name, and use that to display an appropriate screen. Current options are PlayStation (DualSense), Xbox (Series X/S), and Nintendo (Switch Pro Con). Keyboard/Mouse layout will follow soon(ish).</p>
                <p>Specifying controller layouts for different controllers is difficult though, since I don't know the controller's names (I currently only have the following strings: “PS5 Controller”, “XInput Gamepad” (through emulation using DS4Windows), and “Nintendo Switch Pro Controller”).</p>
                <p>Another difficulty is figuring out which controller layout to show if multiple controllers are connected, or when KBM is used even though a controller is connected. I currently check for the first connected controller, which means that, if multiple controllers are connected, the layout shown may be wrong. Furthermore, connecting a controller always overrides the KBM layout, since KBM is currently the default. A solution to this may be to check which controller last sent an input, and retrieving that controller's name.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">Implementing RigidBody3D Character Movement</h3>
                <p>Today's task: reimplementing my player character as a <code>RigidBody3D</code>. In the example below, it is using <code>CharacterController3D</code>. I wanted to make this change to get more natural feeling movement and physics, particularly in carrying momentum.</p>

                </video>
                <p>This is the result of the <code>RigidBody3D</code> implementation in my character. I used a script from the following video, which served as a great base – the only good one I could find, in fact. Most people on the internet seem to want others to use <code>CharacterController3D</code>, and for good reasons; it's simple, it works, and it's easy to adjust and tweak, unlike a <code>RigidBody3D</code>. And so I had to admit: I wasn't happy with my implementation. I changed the script in large parts, only keeping a few segments, but it never felt quite like I wanted to. It felt too loose.</p>

                <p><code>RigidBody3D</code> also greeted me with some bugs I had encountered in Unity but was initially spared from when I switched to Godot and its <code>CharacterController3D</code> implementation. A significant issue was the double jump; the character would often not be able to recognise that it had been grounded, and thus it would not allow the player to jump again. Another issue was glitching; the video shows how the character sinks into the ground briefly before jumping up. I have no idea why this happened.</p>
                <video controls class="video-block centred width-restricted">

                </video>
                <p>Using a momentum-based character also introduces the issue of sliding up slopes and ramps with the carried momentum a little more than I would like.</p>
                <video controls class="video-block centred width-restricted">

                </video>
                <p>And so, after 10 hours of implementing RigidBody3D, I decided to go back to CharacterController3D. I played a bit of Ratchet & Clank for reference, and decided that they might be using a <code>RigidBody</code> implementation (did a <code>CharacterController</code> even exist back then? Did their engine support that even?), but I could get closer to their movement more easily using a <code>CharacterController</code> and emulating a few momentum-based movements using lerp</code>s.</p>
                <p>The effort was not in vain, however! I implemented the ground <code>RayCast</code> that was necessary for my <code>RigidBody3D</code> implementation in my <code>CharacterController</code>, which, together with a plane calculation, allows for adjusting the character movement velocity when moving on slopes! This corrects the player's uphill speed, and it also prevents jumpy movement when running down a slope! It's currently a little glitch-prone though, crashing the game when standing on Sans, for example, but I'll fix that soon.</p>

For UI elements, supplying the key in the text field suffices, and for strings in script, use <code>tr(key)</code>. Easy as that!</p>

                <p>The camera system has been replaced! This implementation simply uses <code>SpringArm3D</code> with a <code>Camera3D</code> as its child. This allows for the camera to not clip into walls (though it really likes clipping into the floor for some reason), and overall feels much more responsive. Not just that though – the player's movement input is now adjusted to where the camera points! When the player presses forward, they are now moving in the direction the camera is pointing. Previously, movement was independent from the camera's rotation, which of course wouldn't make sense for a game like this.</p>

                <p>Gravity is fixed, and the camera angle has been adjusted, though not fixed to the character yet. It's kind of funny watching this little character move around.</p>

                <h3 class="gradient-title">One Small Step</h3>
                <p>A character has been added and the player can control them! It's influenced by gravity too, although it falls at an unnaturally rapid rate when thrown off the edge. This is because the downward velocity kept increasing even when grounded, and is fixed in a later version. Also, the character faces the wrong direction; moving forward results in the character facing the camera instead of forward. This is fixed once I replaced the character model with one where it's more obvious which side is forward.</p>
