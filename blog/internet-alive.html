                <p>You know what I miss? The old internet.</p>
                <p>A network of personal websites dedicated to specific niches, not seeking a profit or similar gain, but instead, places where people shared their interests purely out of their own interest.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I'm the wrong person to say this – after all, having been born in 2001, I am not old enough to have grown up experiencing the 90's internet, or even the early 2000's internet. My first internet access must have been in the late 00's, while I only got my first laptop in 2011.</p>
                <p>Yet, I find enjoyment in viewing other people's personal internet pages. There's something oddly charming about viewing the personal interests of people – of course only those that they allow the world to see.</p>
                <p>This is why I'm working on my own website. I want to contribute to a web that's based not on commercialism and hype technology, but rooted in personal interests and interesting experiences.</p>
                <p>These kind of websites just have a cool vibe, you know?</p>
