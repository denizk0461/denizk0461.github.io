        <img class="centred width-restricted" src="/resources/misc/404.webp" alt="A four-panel meme. The first panel is person A telling person B that the link they were trying to access does not exist. The second panel is person B asking person A for the correct link, implying that person A would know which link person B wanted to access. In the third panel, person A is depicted with a natural facial expression, implying that person A is thinking about what person B just asked. In the fourth panel, person A is depicted with an angry facial expression, identical to panel 3 but with their eyebrows pointed to suggest an angry face. The joke is that person A is angry at person B because person B assumes that person A would know which website they were trying to access.">
